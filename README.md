# JavaScript Modules Exercise ðŸ§©

Hello, future software developers! This curated set of exercises is your gateway to mastering JavaScript modules. Delve into the core features of JavaScript's modular system, from the basics of named and default exports to the advanced techniques of dynamic imports and handling side effects. Each exercise is crafted to build upon your understanding, encouraging you to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios. Embark on this journey to refine your coding expertise and unlock new levels of efficiency and organization in your projects.

## Exercises ðŸ“‹

1. **Named Exports and Imports:** Create an inventory management system for an online store, practicing the use of named exports and imports.
   - Implement `inventory.mjs`, exporting named functions: `addItem` that adds an item by name to the inventory array, `removeItem` that removes an item by name from the inventory array, `listItems` that logs all item names currently in the inventory.
   - Implement `storeManager.mjs` that imports the functions from `inventory.mjs` to demonstrate adding a few items, removing an item, and then listing the remaining items in the inventory.
2. **Default Export and Import:** Use default exports and imports by developing a blogging module.
   - Create `Post.mjs`, exporting a default `Post` class that includes a constructor for `title` and `content`, and a `publish` method that logs the title and content to the console.
   - Create `blog.mjs` that imports the `Post` class. Create an instance, and call the `publish` method to simulate posting.
3. **Re-exporting Modules:** Organize utility functions using re-exporting techniques to create a streamlined import process.
   - Create a `utils` directory. Within the utils directory, create individual modules: `stringUtils.mjs` for string manipulation functions and `numberUtils.mjs` for numeric operations that export various utility functions. Implement the `index.mjs`, which aggregates and re-exports all utility functions from the utils directory, facilitating a single point of import.
   - Create `app.mjs` that imports utilities from the aggregated `utils/index.mjs` and demonstrates their use.
4. **Dynamic Imports:** Utilize dynamic imports for conditionally loading modules for theme management based on time.
   - Create `theme.mjs`, which exports functions that manage the application's theme. The function `setLightTheme` and `setDarkTheme` set and log the theme being set to the console.
   - Create `app.js`. Implement an async function, `loadConfig,` that dynamically imports the `theme.mjs` and decides which theme function to call based on the current hour (e.g., light theme before 6 PM, dark theme afterward).
5. **Side Effects in Modules:** Create a module that automatically executes code upon import, demonstrating module side effects.
   - Develop `globalConfig.mjs` to log a message, simulating a global configuration setup.
   - Import `globalConfig.mjs` in `app.mjs` to observe the automatic execution of its side effects upon module load without needing to explicitly invoke any functions.

Happy coding!
